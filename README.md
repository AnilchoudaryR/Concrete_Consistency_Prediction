# Concrete_consistency_prediction
The task is based on measurement data from one concrete mixer. The concrete mixer is equipped with sensors which measure oil pressure of the hydraulic drum engine, drum rotation speed &amp; concrete weight. The concrete consistency is measured once at the mixing plant site outside of the mixing drum by a defined measurement procedure. Following same procedure each time is time consuming. So machine learning is used to predict the concrete consistency which helps in both saving money and time.
